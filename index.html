What is provisioning?
- Preparing a server
- Installing packages
- Configuration

... and how is that different from deployment?
- Deployment is about updating app code, not server settings

Why would I use a provisioner tool? You just set up a server once don't you?!
- Servers are cattle, not pets
- Can you remember everything you did to set up a server?
  - Server updates and pinning
  - Ruby install
  - Database setup
  - Nginx config
  - Service monitoring
  - Logging
  - Sendmail...
  - Timezones?!
- Repeatable setups, anywhere

I think we can already see some use cases
- Any old server set-up
- Vagrant
- Cloud instances management
- Workbox set-up

OK OK! What shall I use then?
- SOMETHING!!!
- Chef
- Puppet
- Salt
- Ansible ...
- ... finally! We get to the point!!

Ansible and its approach
- Python, so pretty universal
- Uses SSH, so no installing on remote systems
- Scripting with YAML, so even an idiot can use it

Getting set up
- Current version is 1.6.x
- Install..
  - apt:
    - `apt-get install ansible` gets you 1.5.4
  - pip:
    - `easy_install pip`
    - `pip install ansible`
  - source:
    - `easy_install pip`
    - `pip install pyyaml jinja2 nose passlib pycrypto`
    - `git clone git@github.com:ansible/ansible.git`
    - `source ./hacking/env-setup`

hosts
- host files
  - INI format
  - looks in `/etc/ansible/hosts`

    [appservers]
    192.168.1.23
    192.168.1.99

    or

    [myapp:children]
    appservers
    dbservers

    [appservers]
    pedrosa.example.com ansible_ssh_user=dani
    lorenzo.example.com ansible_ssh_user=jorge

    [dbservers]
    db-[a:f].example.com

- hosts as a var
  - just pass it on the command line
    - `ansible -i 192.168.1.46, do-something-interesting`


Basic commands - aka ad-hoc
- Issuing commands
  - `ansible appservers -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"`
- I NEVER DO THIS!!!1!

Playbooks
- I ALWAYS DO THIS!!!2!

- Ok, basic idea

  ---
  # playbook.yml

  - hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Super secure secret sharing stuff
        copy: src=secrets.txt dest=/srv/public/secrets.txt mode=777

  `ansible-playbook appservers playbook.yml`


- Vars

  ---
  # playbook
  - hosts: appservers
    vars:
      my_common_packages:
        - curl
        - git
    tasks:
      - name: Install some stuff
        apt: pkg={{ item }} state=present
        with_items: my_common_packages



  There are also a lot of built in variables, like `{{ ansible_pkg_mgr }}`

    - name: Install some stuff on Debian
      apt: pkg={{ item }} state=present
      with_items:
        - curl
        - git
      when: ansible_pkg_mgr == "apt"



- modules

  There are loads
    apt, git, pg/mysql/redis..,
    ec2/linode...
    raw shell scripts


- templates

  jinja2

  ---
  # playbook.yml

  - hosts: all
    vars_prompt:
      name: "What is your name?"
      loot: "Where is the money?"
    tasks:
      - name: Super secure secret sharing stuff
        copy: src=secrets.txt dest=/srv/public/secrets.txt mode=777


  # secrets.txt
  My name is {{ name }}
  The cash is at {{ loot }}


Roles and best practice

  site.yml

  /roles
    /nginx
      /handlers
        main.yml
      /tasks
        main.yml
      /templates
        nginx.conf
      /vars
        main.yml
